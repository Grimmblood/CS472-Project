# *** NOTE *** Tasks for the project
# What the task is and who has expierience / planning on working on it 

Needs
    Map
        2 Base Areas
		Each base area should be just a spot with a fair amount of space where there is only structure plots
        Structure Foundations (7?)
		A structure foundation is basically just a reserved space where you are allowed to build a structure
    Lane
	The lane in the center of the map connects the two bases together, and allows units to move between the two
Camera Controls
    WASD / Edge Panning
	If the player uses the WASD keys, the camera should move in that direction, and similarly, should move in that direction if the cursor reaches the edge of the screen.
    Zoom Levels? Scale?
	If the player scrolls on the mouse wheel, the camera should get lower to or farther from the ground. May consider using some 'zoom levels'
		There will be a 'floor' and 'ceiling' so the camera doesn't go under the map or too far into the sky
HUD? (Warcraft Style?)
     Minimap
	A smaller representation of the entire game space, using varying sized colored squares to represent units or buildings of that faction
     Selection Panel
	Should contain the name and stats of the last building/unit clicked on
     Utilities Menu
	Build Button
		Opens the Building Submenu, where the player selects a building to build
Factions
    Color?
	Each faction should arbitrarily have a color assigned to them for quick identification with the minimap
    Hostility
	Each faction should have a list of factions that they will not attack, and their units will attack all others
    Player
	Units and structures with this faction designation will be attacked by units that are hostile to this faction
    Opponent
	Units and structures with this faction designation will be attacked by units that are hostile to this faction
    Neutral
	Used for the Capture the Flag game mode, cannot be attacked by any faction
Structures
    Build on Foundation
	Only one structure can be built on a foundation at a time, and structures must be built on a foundation
    Building Flow (supplemental NOT A TASK, purely for demonstration)
	Click build button on HUD, change utilities menu to building menu, click desired building icon, click desired foundation, building should build there, done
    Types (6?)
	Gold Generator
		Automatically generates X gold every Y interval
	Resource 2 Generator
		Automatically generates X Resource 2 every Z interval
			Z should probably be higher than Y
	Barracks
		Automatically generates units every W interval
	Defense Tower?
	Heavy Barracks?
		Automatically generates units from a different selection every W interval 
	Upgrade Building?
    Building Stats (TBD don't pick up building stats tasks yet)
	Health
		The health of the building. If this reaches 0, the building is destroyed.
	Armor
		The armor of a building should be uniform across all buil
		Resistances & Vulnerabilities
			Strong vs Ranged
			Weak v Siege?
Units
    Types (6?)
         Light Melee
         Medium Melee
         Heavy Melee
         Light Ranged
         Medium Ranged
         Siege?
    Unit Stats
	Health
		The health of the unit. If this reaches 0, the unit is killed.
        Armor
		The armor of the unit, it determines the types of damage that it is resistant to
        	Type
             		Resistances & Vulnerabilites
				Each type of armor gives certain types of damage that it is resistant or vulnerable to
				Resistance = take 1/2 damage
				Vulnerable = Take 2x Damage	
        Damage
		Type
			Each unit deals damage of a specific type (melee, ranged, or siege?)
		Amount
			The amount of health the attacked unit or structure loses, before resistances & vulnerabilities
        Move Speed
		How fast the unit moves
Enemy AI
     Build Buildings on Plots
Unit AI
     Movement
          Move Down Lane
		Move towards the opponent's base, may need to navigate around units that aren't moving (units in combat, or units that are stuck for whatever reason)
     Combat
          Attack Nearby Always
		If an attackable unit is nearby, go into 'attack mode' and fight that attackable unit
Objectives (2?)
      Capture the Flag / King of the Hill
	Mobile Flag in the middle that is controlled by whoever had the most units around it last
	Slowly moves to the base of whoever controls it

            Exhaust opponentâ€™s lives to win
Upgrades? (TBD)
   Unit Upgrades
	Health
	Damage
	Armor
	Move Speed?
   Building Upgrades
	Resource Generation Rate?
